Name: Suggestions, for Destiny 2

Description: This app is designed for the game “Destiny 2”, focused on endgame PvE. The main features are the app are:
- Give suggestions for weapon loadouts in endgame PvE, based on the activity/encounter and what other fireteam members are using, using roles I have defined and “the meta” for each role in each encounter.
- Give suggestions for what you may want to do today based on a curated set of endgame PvE activities.
    - Also display information about bounties in those areas, in an easy to see way (called the Bounty Board)
- Use PGCR data to visually display data about the player that is generally hidden away.

How to run the app: All that is needed is to run the app normally. Run "tp.py" in order to start the app.
The only requirement is that you must be online at that moment in Destiny 2, or else it will crash.
The app requires data that the API only provides for a currently online/active Destiny 2 account.

Word of caution: although I have designed the app to be usable for people across all platforms (Xbox, Playstation, Steam, Stadia), I have only tested the app on Steam due to real-life limitations.
This is because I do not have a Xbox or Playstation to test it with.

Libraries used: cmu_112_graphics, requests, random, time, calendar.

No shortcut commands. Press "Escape" to go back, and use the mouse or instructions on the screen to navigate the app.

Special thanks to LoneWarden, Chiggen, Romanz, Chomp, OneFiveThree, Serotonin, and the rest of the REVAMP clan for acting as fireteam members and testers.
Without them, many more bugs and issues would have gotten past me, and I would not have been able to make this project.
